🚀 Root Detection, SSL Pinning & Emulator Detection Bypass — Android Frida Script
A powerful, consolidated Frida script to bypass multiple Android security mechanisms — compatible with both native and Flutter-based applications.

🔐 What Does It Bypass?
📱 For Non-Flutter (Native) Applications
🔍 Bypass Type	⚙️ Techniques Covered
SSL Pinning	Java, TrustManagerImpl, SSLContext, Cert Validation
Root Detection	Custom method hooks, file existence checks
Developer Mode Check	Settings.Secure & Settings.Global
Device Info Spoofing	Fake IMSI & SIM serial info

💙 For Flutter-Based Applications
✅ Feature	📖 Description
Developer Mode Check	Hooks Settings.getInt() to fake developer mode status
Telephony Info	Spoofs IMSI & SIM serial values
Root Detection	Custom hooks & file-based detection bypass
SSL Pinning (Generic)	Bypasses Conscrypt, HttpsURLConnection, etc.
SSL Pinning (Flutter)	Hooks ssl_verify_peer_cert using pattern matching

🧠 How It Works
This script combines multiple techniques into one payload for comprehensive coverage, including:

Runtime method hooking

Memory pattern matching (for native libraries like libflutter.so)

Telephony spoofing to evade environment-based detection

Custom bypasses for modern Flutter TLS validation logic

📦 Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
frida -U -n <package-name> -l bypass.js
✅ Tested on various rooted emulators and devices, including apps using modern Flutter builds.

🛠️ Requirements
Frida (latest stable)

Rooted or test environment

App running in debuggable mode (recommended for full access)
